# Amanda Yee - Personal Portfolio

Final term project for CS601 Web Application Development at Boston University. Summer 1 semester 2023.

## Project goal

The goal of this project is to design and develop a personal portfolio website containing 5-10 pages to showcase the skills that I have learnt in CS601 this semester. These skills include:
- Web languages 
- HTML5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript
- Vue
- Web page layout and design
- Document object model (DOM)
- Website usability
- Project management for web design and development

## Project highlights

There are a few features on my portfolio that I am proud of incorporating:
1. The typewriter effect on the home page, implemented using JavaScript
2. CSS Flex to make the web pages responsive
3. Using JavaScript to create the HTML code for the US states table and including template strings from ES6
4. A Vue.js application to change an image upon hover on the Travel page
