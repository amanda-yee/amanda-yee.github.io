            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>
                Travelling is one of my favorite hobbies as it lets me take a break from my everyday life and explore new places. 
                I feel fortunate that I have been able to travel to a lot of different places and countries throughout my life so far.
                I love getting to experience and learn about different cultures as well as try new things. 
                It is the perfect activity for me to unwind, relax and have fun with my family and friends.
                Below are a few memorable trips that I have been on.

                <h3>Panama</h3>
                    <p>
                        A recent trip that I really enjoyed was going to Panama in January this year.
                        I went with a friend over a long weekend and it was the perfect escape from the New York winter.
                        We spent majority of our time there relaxing on the beach in Contadora Island. This is one of my favorite pastimes, likely because I grew up in a beach town.
                        We also visited the Panama Canal and got to see the changing of the locks which was cool to experience.

                <h3>Utah</h3>
                <p>
                    I went to Utah in April 2021 to do a hiking trip for a friend's birthday. 
                    It was very memorable and is one of my favorite trips that I have done so far in the US. 
                    We did multiple hikes at Zion National Park (including Angel's Landing and the Narrows) and we also hiked at Bryce Canyon National Park. 
                    These were two of the longest hikes I have done to date, with the round trips being 3 - 4 hours.
                    In addition, a few of us also did mountain biking and rented out ATVs while in Utah which was so much fun!

            <h2>US States</h2>
            <p>
                Within the US there are a lot of great places to visit so I have made it my goal to visit all 50 states.
