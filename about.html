            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I currently reside in New York but I was born in New Zealand and grew up on the Gold Coast in Australia.
            I made the move to the US in November 2019 for work. 
            I initially lived in Chicago and was travelling weekly to Arkansas for that job until the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
            I have since made the move to New York and have lived in Brooklyn for two years now.
            For the longest time it has been a dream to live in New York so I feel very fortunate that it has become my reality.
            <br><br>
            I completed a Bachelors in Actuarial Science and with that degree I have worked as a data scientist for the past five years.
            I am currently enrolled at Boston University pursuing a Masters in Software Development.
            Upon completion of my Masters degree I hope to use the knowledge gained to pivot to a career as a front end web developer.
            My first exposure to coding was frequently changing my MySpace profile by editing the source code so becoming a web developer will be a full circle moment!
            One of my favorite things to change was the song that would play when someone would visit my profile. <br><br>
            With that, this is one of my current favorite songs:
